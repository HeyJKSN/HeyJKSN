# Hello, I'm Jackson Davis! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an 18-year-old gunzel from Victoria, passionate about exploring Melbourne's Public Transport. Here are a couple of projects I'm currently working on:

- [HeyJKSN.com](https://heyjksn.com) - My main website where you can find all my socials (like Twitter, YouTube), think of it as a Linktree or Carrd
- [Photos.HeyJKSN.com](https://photos.heyjksn.com) - Photography website (all photos are uploaded to this site via a GitHub repo)

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat. You can email me at [jackson.z.davis@icloud.com](mailto:jackson.z.davis@icloud.com).

Catch you on the platform!
